        # There are three ways in which you can support Hedy!
-   title: Improving the language
    text: |
        The gradual and multi-lingual nature of Hedy create a lot of interesting technical challenges.
        Find those issues on [Github](https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Alanguage).
-   title: Translating Hedy
    text: |
        Not a programmer? No problem! Another way to support Hedy is by [translating keywords, error messages, adventures are other content](https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/wiki/Hedy-Translation-Tutorial)

        This is the current status, help us complete a language, or add a new one!

    -   title: Apa itu Hedy?
        text: |
            Hedy adalah bahasa pemrograman berbasis tekstual, dikembangkan khusus untuk (pra)remaja (10 sampai 15 tahun).
            Berbeda dengan bahasa-bahasa pemrograman untuk anak-anak, seperti Scratch, Hedy tidak menggunakan blok kode namun kode tekstual.
            Jadi dengan Hedy siswa akan belajar bagaimana menuliskan kode seperti pemrogram pada umumnya, tapi dengan beberapa langkah-langkah kecil dan latihan-latihan yang menyenangkan.
            Dengan cara ini Hedy dapat berfungsi sebagai batu lonkucingan untuk ke bahasa pemrograman sesungguhnya seperti Python dalam cara yang mudah dan menyenangkan!
            Disini guru bisa menonton [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqT313rM40&amp;t=2s) tentang pengembangan Hedy sebagai sebuah bahasa pemrograman.
    -   title: Target pengguna
        text: |
            Hedy dikembangkan untuk siswasekolah menengah pertama dan sekolah dasar (umur 10 - 15).
            Penting untuk diingat bahwa para siswa perlu bisa membaca dengan baik. Kami tidak merekomendasikan penggunakan Hedy untuk siswa dibawah kelas 3.
            Siswa (dan guru!) tidak memerlukan pengalaman pemrograman sebelum memulai Hedy.

            <Todo>
    -   title: Mengajar dengan Hedy
        text: |
            Hedy dibagi menjadi beberapa level, dengan perintah-perintah baru yang diajarkan. Setiap level berisi latihan-latihan untuk menguasai perintah yang baru dipelajari.
            Latihan-latihan dapat dilakukan oleh siswa secara independen, atau guru dapat menggunakannya dalam instruksi-instruksi klasik.
            Rencana pengajaran untuk setiap level disediakan di manual untuk guru. Rencana pengajaran dan latihan dijelaskan langkah demi langkah, untuk memastikan bahwa guru-guru yang tidak terlalu terbiasa dengan teknologi pun dapat mengikutinya!
            Tentu saja Hedy juga mengakomodasi guru-guru kreatif yang ingin membuat rencana pengajaran dan latihannya sendiri!
    -   title: Perangkat-perangkat
        text: |
            Hedy berbasis web, yang artinya dapat berfungsi dengan perangkat apapun asalkan memiliki browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge dan lainnya).
            Jadi laptop, chromebooks, tablet, ataupun perangkat mobile dapat digunakan untuk menggunakan Hedy.
            Tidak ada kebutuhan untuk unduh apapun agar dapat menggunakan Hedy, guru hanya perlu ke websitenya dan memulainya!

        text: |
            You can prepare your classes at the <a href="https://hedy.org/for-teachers" target="_blank">For Teachers page</a>. On this page you'll find everything you'll need to teach with Hedy, like your classes, your adventures and slides. All the functionalities of the for teachers page are explained below.
    -   title: Login (masuk ke website)
        text: |
            Untuk memulai pemrograman dengan Hedy, kunjungi situs berikut:
            [https://www.hedy.org/](https://www.hedy.org/)
            Klik Login di bagian kanan atas. Dengan ini guru bisa masuk menggunakan username dan password guru. Apakah ini pertama kalinya guru menggunakan Hedy? Klik tombol hijau Create an account.
            Tip: Pilihlah username dan password yang dapat dengan mudah guru hafal, atau tuliskan di selembar kertas!
    -   title: Customize your Class
        text: |
            You can customize your class and choose which adventures are available for your students. This way your students won't be overwhelmed by the amount of adventures and levels, and they can specifically focus on the adventures you'd like them to practice with.
            Click on your class on the for teachers page and choose 'customize class'. On this page you can select levels, set opening dates, unlock level tresholds and more.

            **Select and order adventures**
            <img src="https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/df38cbb2-468e-4317-ac67-92eaf4212adc" width="1000">
            In this section you can select and order adventures. The pink tabs are adventures with new commands. The gray tabs are regular adventures. To rearrange the order of the adventures, you can drag the tabs. However, we do advise you to use the regular order of adventures as the Hedy team made sure the adventures go from easiest to hardest.
            If you want to remove an adventure for your students, simply click the cross on the adventure's tab.
            <img src="https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/0ddd10b5-ef60-4480-a0c4-fc9a0f323baa" width="300">
            If you want to add adventures, for instance your own adventure or an adventure you accidentally removed, use this menu to add the adventure to your students' adventures. Simply click the adventure you want to add and it (re)appears in the line of adventures. To undo all your changes to the adventures, click 'Reset'.

            **Opening dates**
            <img src="https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/4e59acfa-4772-429f-8328-babb43c942d5" width="300">
            With this feature you can set open_ingdates for the levels. This way you can make a lesson plan before your course begins and not worry about opening new levels each week. In the image above the first level is opened directly, the second will open the 23th of september, and the 3rd level the week after. The other levels are closed.
            Don't want to set opening dates? No problem, just leave this section blank.

            **Unlock level tresholds**
            <img src="https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/99a34dab-f112-459e-bfd1-07618be4715a" width = "1000">
            This featue allows you to set a treshold for your students' quiz grade, before they can continue to the next level. For example, if you enter "80" your students have to score at least 80% on the quiz before they are allowed to go to the next level. If they haven't met the treshold, they are not allowed to continue and have to retake the quiz.
            Don't want to use the treshold? No worries, just keep this section blank.


            **Other settings**
            <img src="https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/a8491d67-6d6e-42a7-b672-fd3d083a76f8"/>
            There are some other setting that could be usefu to you aswell. Our first extra setting is 'Mandatory developer's mode'. In developers mode the students only see their input and output screens and the run button. The adventures are hidden and there are no cheatsheets available. This might come in handy in a test situation.
            If this option is not selected the developer's mode is available for students too as a voluntairy option.

            If you want all your students to be visible in de class highscore, you can select the second option.
            With all the other options you can choose to hide some functions or content for your students, this might help them focus more.

            **Save**
            <img src="https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy/assets/80678586/df179df3-3073-4d15-bba6-62e58fb675be" width="300">
            Don't forget to save your changes when you're done costumizing your class.
    -   title: Menyimpan program-program
        text: |
            Setelah guru masuk, guru akan melihat spanduk biru dengan My profile dan My programs.
            Pada My programs guru dapat menemukan semua kode program yang pernah guru simpan.
            Guru dapat menyimpan proyek-proyek guru dengan memberikan nama di bar putih dan menekan tombol hijau Save Code.
            Mari memulai pemrograman yang menyenangkan!
    -   title: Setting preferred language
        text: |
            When students create profile they are supposed to choose a 'preferred language'. Hedy will always be loaded in this selected language.
            Changing this language can always be done later on by navigation to 'My account' and 'My personal settings' again.
            From December 2021 on setting a preferred language is obligatory for each Hedy account.
            When your account or the accounts of your students have being created earlier than this date you will receive a message that a preferred language is missing.
            Don't worry! Navigate to 'My profile' and set a language in your profile settings.
            Until you set a language Hedy will be shown in your browser language and, when this language is not supported, in English.

            **For non-English speakers**
            Not only can you change the language of the adventures to your own language. You can also choose which language the keywords (for example 'print' or 'ask') should be in.
            This way you can teach your students to code with English keywords, but you can also let them program in their own laguage. For example Dutch students can use the command 'vraag' instead of 'ask'.
    -   title: Storing programs
        text: |
            Because you are now logged in, you'll see the blue banner with My profile and My programs.
            These tabs exist for your students too. In My programs you can find all the codes that you've saved.

            You can save your projects easily by giving your project a name in the white bar and pressing the green button Save Code.
            You (and your students) can also share programs. These programs will be posted on our explore page, for everybody to see and use.
            If you want to unshare your program, go to 'My programs' and click 'Unshare'.

    -   title: ' '
        text: |
            Hedy berisi banyak level dan setiap level mengajarkan kemampuan baru. Kami merekomendasikan untuk mengajar satu level per sesi.
            Ini memberikan para siswa waktu untuk mengerti perintah-perintah atau konsep yang baru dan berlatih dengannya, sebelum pindah ke level berikutnya.
            Kami menggunakan struktur ini di sesi-sesi kami:
    -   title: Slides
        text: |
            When giving instructions you might want to use our slides. Our slides are available on the 'For teachers' page. There is a set of slides for each level. In the slides all the new commands for that level are explained. We have aimed to explain why these changes are nessecary or how the new commands come in handy.
            We also give some examples of how the new commands can be used. You could of course also use your own slides, or just open Hedy and show your students around the website. Whichever you prefer to give the best Hedy lessons!
    -   title: Pengenalan
        text: |
            Guru dapat memulai pengajaran dengan mengingatkan kembali siswa akan pengetahuan terkait yang pernah mereka miliki: apa yang telah mereka ketahui tentang pemrograman, apa yang telah mereka pelajari, dan apa kesalahan-kesalahan yang pernah mereka buat.
            Dengan cara ini, semua perintah-perintah dan kesalahan-kesalahan yang pernah dilakukan akan teringat di benak para siswa ketika guru memulai pengajaran.
    -   title: Langkah - langkah terkait konsep dan perintah baru
        text: |
            Konsep dan perintah baru bisa jadi menantang bagi beberapa siswa untuk dipelajari.
            Karenanya sangat penting untuk memodelkan penggunaan yang tepat dari perintah-perintah yang ada ke para siswa, terutama di level-level awal ketika para siswa tidak memiliki pengalaman pemrograman sama sekali. Menampilkan banyak contoh dapat membuat konsep abstrak yang dipelajari (misal: 'Apa itu variabel') menjadi lebih mudah dipahami ('Lihat, variabel peliharaan sekarang berisi kucing').
    -   title: Mari mulai bekerja
        text: |
            Setiap level berisi berbagai petualangan yang dapat kamu temui di tab berwarna merah muda. Tab merah muda pertama menjelaskan perintah-perintah baru pada level tersebut.
            Tab-tab berikutnya adalah petualangan yang siswa dapat coba.
            Petualangan-petualangan yang ada diurutkan dari yang termudah ke yang tersulit, jadi kami merekomendasikan untuk memulai dari kiri dan berjalan perlahan ke kanan.
            Tab terakhir berjudul 'Apa berikutnya?' memberikan sedikit informasi terkait apa yang akan siswa pelajari di level selanjutnya.
            Tentu saja, guru dapat memilih petualangan mana yang akan digunakan oleh para siswa di setiap level. Mereka tidak selalu harus menyelesaikan semua petualangan.
            Setiap petualangan berisi kode contoh, yang dapat dicoba oleh siswa dengan menekan tombol hijau.
            Kode contoh akan tersalin di area kode dan siswa dapat mencoba menjalankan kode terkait dan menyesuaikannya sesuai dengan keinginannya.
            Dorong siswa-siswa untuk mengubah kode contoh yang ada menjadi proyek mereka sendiri dengan menambahkan ide-ide atau variasi unik mereka terhadap petualangan yang ada.
    -   title: Kuis
        text: |
            Untuk menguji apakah para siswa sudah menguasai semua informasi yang diberikan pada level tertentu, guru dapat meminta mereka menyelesaikan sebuah kuis.
            Setiap kuis berisi 10 pertanyaan pilihan ganda terkait konsep-konsep dan perintah-perintah baru pada level tersebut.
            Belum setiap level memiliki kuis, karena kami sedang mengembangkan kuis-kuis tersebut.
    -   title: Evaluasi
        text: |
            Akhiri pelajaran dengan memberikan evaluasi umum. Apa yang para siswa telah pelajari? Kesulitan-kesulitan apa yang mereka hadapi?
            Bagaimana mereka belajar dari kesalahan-kesalahan mereka? Dan tentu saja: Apa yang mereka berhasil buat?
            Para siswa cenderung bangga atas hasil kreasi mereka sendiri, jadi adalah baik untuk menyediakan waktu dan kesempatan bagi para siswa untuk menampilkan karya mereka di depan teman-temannya.

-   title: Frequently made mistakes
    levels:
    -   level: '1'
        sections:
        -   title: Students forget to type commandos
            example:
                error_text: |
                    For example they type a sentence without using print.
                error_code: |
                    Hedy can't print this
                solution_text: |
                    Teach your students to always start a line of code with a command.
                solution_code: |
                    print Hedy can print this!
        -   title: Students use capitals when typing commands
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Commands won't work if they are in capitals.
                error_code: |
                    Ask Why does my code fail?
                    Print Because I'm using capitals.
                solution_text: |
                    Remove the capitals.
                solution_code: |
                    ask Why does my code work now?
                    print Because I removed the capitals!
        -   title: Students use echo without ask
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Echo is made to repeat an answer after an ask command. Without ask echo won't do anything.
                error_code: |
                    echo Your name is
                solution_text: |
                    Add an ask command to make it work.
                solution_code: |
                    ask What's your name?
                    echo Your name is
        -   title: Students want their echo word (variable) to be in the middle of a sentence
            example:
                error_text: |
                    And they are right! That's why they will learn to use proper variables in the next level.
                error_code: |
                    ask Which programming language is the most fun?
                    echo is the best!
                solution_text: |
                    In level 1 we have to keep it at this:
                solution_code: |
                    ask Which programming language is the most fun?
                    echo The best is...
        -   title: 'Turtle: Students let the turtle walk off of the screen'
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Often students love to try out big numbers when using the turtle, which causes the arrow to walk off the screen.
                error_code: |
                    forward 300
                    turn 90
                solution_text: |
                    In the example. students tend to think that the turn command doesn't work. Eventhough is does work, but you can't see it happening off screen. Use smaller numbers to prevent this from happening.
                solution_code: |
                    forward 100
                    turn 90

            example:
                error_text: |
                    Backward is not a command.
                error_code: |
                    backward 100
                solution_text: |
                    To make the turtle go backwards, you use the forward command and a negative number. For example:
                solution_code: |
                    forward -100

        -   title: Students make typos in their commands
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Hedy can't recognize a command with a typo.
                error_code: |
                    prinnt Don't make typos!
                solution_text: |
                    Teach your students to read the error messages. This way they can find out themselves what went wrong.
                solution_code: |
                    print Don't make typos!
        -   title: Students forget that the ask command has changed
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In this level students learn about variables. The ask command requires a variable as well, but students forget this.
                error_code: |
                    ask what would you like to eat?
                solution_text: |
                    In this level you have to tell Hedy where to save your answer, so it can be used later on. This is called a variable.
                solution_code: |
                    order is What would you like to eat?
        -   title: 'Students try to use the echo command. '
            example:
                error_text: |
                    For some students it might be frustrating to learn that the echo command doesn't work anymore. That's why it's very important to explain the advantages of using variables. For example you can use multiple variables in a code, and you can put them anywhere you like in a sentence!
                error_code: |
                    answer is ask Why doesn't echo work anymore?!
                    echo
                solution_text: |
                    Use a varible instead.
                solution_code: |
                    answer is ask Why doens't echo work anymore?!
                    print answer
        -   title: Students use a variable name or as a normal word
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In the example below the word 'name' is used a a variable, but also as a normal text. The output of this code will be 'Hi my Hedy is Hedy'.
                error_code: |
                    name is Hedy
                    print Hi my name is name
                solution_text: |
                    So don't use a word you want to use in the text as a variable name. In level 4 this is solved with quotation marks.
                solution_code: |
                    name is Hedy
                    print Hi I'm name
        -   title: Students use long variable names containing two words.
            example:
                error_text: |
                    A variable should be named with one word. You could use an underscore to connect two words. That counts as one.
                error_code: |
                    chosen door is ask Which door do you pick?
                solution_text: |
                    Add an underscore.
                solution_code: |
                    chosen_door is ask which door do you pick?
        -   title: Students might use two different names for the same variable
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In this example the student has used 'horse' and 'name' for the same variables.
                error_code: |
                    horse is ask What is your horse called?
                    print Your horse is called name
                solution_text: |
                    Always check wheter the variable has the same name throughout the code. Slight differences can be hard to spot (for example plurals) but they will interfere with the code.
                solution_code: |
                    name is ask What is your horse called?
                    print Your horse is called name

            example:
                error_text: |
                    A list can't be printed. You can only print one item from the list with at random.
                error_code: |
                    groceries is apples, milk, chocolate
                    print groceries
                solution_text: |
                    To print a list of all the groceries, you simply need to put them after a print command. Else you can use the list to print one item with at random.
                solution_code: |
                    print apples, milk, chocolate

                    or

                    groceries is apples, milk, chocolate
                    print groceries at random
        -   title: Students use the name of a variable or list as regular text.
            example:
                error_text: |
                    This problem probably occured in level 2 as well. Now it can happen with lists too.
                error_code: |
                    name is Hedy
                    print Hi my name is name

                    or

                    animal is rhino, bee, swan
                    print The best animal is... animal at random
                solution_text: |
                    Don;t use the names of variables or lists in regular text to print. In level 4 this problem is solves with quotation marks.
                solution_code: |
                    name is Hedy
                    print Hi I'm name

                error_code: |
                    birds is sparrow, seagull, robin
                    print birds random
                solution_text: |
                    This problem is solved by adding the word at.
                solution_code: |
                    birds is sparrow, seagull, robin
                    print birds at random
        -   title: Students forget to use the print command when also using the at random command.
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Or they will sometimes put at random at the beginning of the line.
                error_code: |
                    fruit is apple, cherry, banana
                    fruit at random
                solution_text: |
                    Emphasize to your students that you always need a print to print text.
                solution_code: |
                    fruit is apple, cherry, banana
                    print fruit at random
        -   title: Students forget to use commas in their lists
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In a list items are seperated with a comma.
                error_code: |
                    pizzas is funghi tonno quattro stagioni
                    print pizzas at random
                solution_text: |
                    After each item on your list, there should be a comma
                solution_code: |
                    pizzas is funghi, tonno, quattro stagioni
                    print pizzas at random
        -   title: Students try to use at random without a list.
            example:

                    print clubs at random
                solution_text: |
                    Hedy can't print anything at random, because there is no list to choose from.
                solution_code: |

                solution_text: |
                    There has to be a list first, so you have to add a second name to turn names into a list, for example Amy. If you don't want amy on your list, you can use remove to remove it after.
                solution_code: |
                    names is Jake, Amy
                    your_name is ask Who are you?

            example:
                error_text: |
                    It is important to start your lesson by checking if the students know how to type a quotation mark properly. ELse they might use the "double quotes" or the `skewed one`.
                error_code: |
                    print `Welcome to the restaurant`

            example:
                error_text: |
                    In this level there are no quotes around variable names.
                error_code: |
                    if 'name' is 'Hedy' print 'fun'

                    if name is Jesse, David, Souf print 'You are funny' else print 'You are not funny'
                solution_text: |
                    You could use the `in` command for that. It is explained in a higher level, but it does already work in level 5.
                    Another solution is to use multiple if commands and no else command. The disadvantage is that it won't tell the other classmates that they are not funny.
                solution_code: |
                    friends is Jesse, David, Souf

            example:
                error_text: |
                    In this level you can only repeat one line of code multiple times. In this code the student wanted to print 3 different drinks, but it won't work. It will ask the question 3 times and only print the last answer.
                error_code: |
                    repeat 3 times drink = ask 'What would you like to drink?'
                    print drink
                solution_text: |
                    You should go to the next level to be able to repeat multiple lines. So on this level you'll have to print everything seperately.

            example:
                error_text: |
                    Indentation is a new concept in this level, that is hard to use for some students. Make sure they practise some simple codes before making a whole program with it.
                error_code: |
                    repeat 3 times
                    print 'hello'
                solution_text: |
                    This is the correct code:
                solution_code: |
                    repeat 3 times
                        print 'hello'
        -   title: Students only repeat 1 line when they wanted to repeat multiple lines
            example:
                error_text: |
                    For instance, in the code below the student wanted to take the drinks order of 3 people. But insted the program asked 3 times, but only wrote down one order.
                error_code: |
                    repeat 3 times
                        drink = ask 'What would you like to drink?'
                    print drink
                solution_text: |
                    In the correct code the third line starts with indentation too. This way it belongs to the repeat block and therefore it will be repeated 3 times.
                    Showing your students these differences can help them understand why we need indentation to make our programs work.
                solution_code: |
                    repeat 3 times
                        drink = ask 'What would you like to drink?'
                        print drink

                error_text: |
                    In this level students aren't allowed yet to put if statements inside other if statements or inside repeat loops.
                    In the next level this is allowed.

                    birthday = ask 'Is it you birthday?'
                    if birthday = yes
                        repeat 3 times
                            print 'Hip Hip Hooray!'
                solution_text: |
                    This is the correct code for this level:

        -   title: Students use the if command to check if the variable value is the same as the variable name
            example:
                error_text: |
                    We have seen this mistake by some of our students. They make a password for their computer, but they make the password 'password'.
                    In line 2 the computer is asked to check wheter the variable password is the same as the variable password, so itself. Which means the answer is alway yes.
                    So with this code the answer will always be 'You can come in' no matter what the player fills in.
                error_code: |
                    password is ask 'What is the password?'
                    if password is password
                        print 'You can come in'
                    else
                        print 'You are not allowed'
                solution_text: |
                    You can fix this mistake by adding quotation marks. This way the computer knows that the second password in `if password is 'password'` is a string value (so normal text) and not the variable name.
                solution_code: |
                    password is ask 'What is the password?'
                    if password is 'password'
                        print 'You can come in'

                error_text: |
                    The hardest part about this level is getting the indentation right. Students love nesting if statements, sometimes even inside other nested if statements. Keeping track of indentation can get pretty tough.

                error_text: |
                    Some students don't understand that i is a variable. i is chosen, because it is used in Python programming, but you could just as easily use a different variable name.

            example:
                error_text: |
                    These signs are probably new for most students. Make sure to explain these signs to your students.

        You can learn from your mistakes, especially in coding!
        Making mistakes is unavoidable, and a great opportunity to learn, but for teachers it can be a challenge to find the correct fix for a mistake!
        Especially as the codes get longer and longer as the levels progress. That's why we've made a list with frequently made mistakes in each level, and their solutions.

-   title: Apa itu bahasa pemrograman bertahap?
    text: |
        Belajar pemrograman bisa jadi menantang. Ini bukan karena bahasa pemrogramannya sulit, namun karena ada banyak aturan yang perlu dihafal, sama seperti ketika kamu memulai belajar bahasa Inggris.
        Sama halnya, kamu juga perlu banyak latihan untuk belajar pemrograman.

        Kamu dapat membaca kalimat-kalimat ini dengan mudah. Namun apakah kamu ingat ketika kamu pertama kali belajar membaca? Kamu membutuhkan waktu untuk mengerti setiap karakter.
        Hal ini berlaku juga untuk pemrograman; mungkin dapat menantang pada awalnya tapi nanti akan menjadi semakin mudah!

        Hal baik dari Hedy adalah pembelajaran *bertahap*. Ini artinya kamu tidak perlu belajar semua aturan sekaligus.
        Level-level awal tidak memiliki banyak aturan, sehingga kamu dapat membiasakan diri dengan pemrograman secara nyaman.
        Pada setiap level, kami menambahkan aturan-aturan baru, meningkatkan jumlah perintah yang akan kamu ketahui. Perintah-perintah tersebut adalah instruksi-instruksi bagi komputer.
-   title: Kenapa Hedy bertahap?
    text: |
        Pada video ini, Felienne, pembuat Hedy, menjelaskan mengapa Hedy bertahap.

-   title: Untuk siapa Hedy berguna?
    text: |
        Hedy ditujukan untuk anak-anak yang mau belajar pemrograman! Kamu perlu bisa membaca sedikit bahasa inggris untuk ini.
-   title: Multi-lingual programming
    text: |
        While almost all textual programming language have keywords in English, such as `for` or `repeat`, Hedy can be used in any language! We currently support 39 different languages, including Spanish, Arabic, Simplified Chinese and Hindi. If your language is not available you can always start a a new translation.
-   title: Built for the classroom
    text: |
        Hedy is suitable for kids aged 10 and up and designed for classroom use.
        Teachers can use our free, built-in lesson plans, but can also author their own lessons and load these into the Hedy user interface.
-   title: Apakah aku memerlukan pengalaman pemrograman?
    text: |
        Tidak, itu tidak dibutuhkan. Namun, jika kamu sebelumnya pernah memprogram dengan Scratch atau Python, perintah-perintah yang ada akan terlihat mirip.
-   title: Apakah Hedy gratis?
    text: |
        Ya!
        Hedy juga 'Open Source', yang artinya semua orang yang memiliki kemampuan pemrograman dapat meningkatkan kualitas Hedy. Kamu dapat menemukan kodenya di [GitHub](https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy).
        Jika kamu menyukai Hedy dan ingin berkontribusi, kami menerima (dan sangat bersyukur untuk itu) [Klik disini untuk donasi](https://github.com/sponsors/hedyorg)!
-   title: Apakah saya perlu meng-instal sesuatu?
    text: |
        Tidak. Hedy berjalan di browser, program yang kamu pakai untuk melihat halaman ini (mungkin Chrome, Edge, atau Firefox). Hedy juga berjalan di perangkat mobile ataupun tablet.
