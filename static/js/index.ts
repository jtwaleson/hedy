 *
 * Files that don't export any functions that are used directly from the HTML
 * should be included by using an 'import' statement.
 *
 * If you want to do any work upon loading the page (such as attaching DOM event
 * listeners), define and export an initialization function, and call that
 * from 'initialize.ts'.
