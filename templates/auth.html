{% extends "layout.html" %}
{# Template which adds most JavaScripts and a
default container which you can choose to use or not to use, depending on which
block you fill: - block full_width_content: will give you access to the full
width of the page. Use this if you want to make bars that stretch the width of
the screen. You are responsible for setting a maximum width somewhere, for
example with 'common-page-container'. - block regular_content: will give you a
limited-width, padded container to put some content into that doesn't need too
much control over the layout. #}
{% block full_width_content %}
  <div id="auth_main_container" class="common-page-container">
    {% block regular_content %}{% endblock %}
  </div>
