      <p>
        Hedy is now (partly) available in Arabic, Bengali, Bulgarian, Czech,
        Dutch, English, French, Frisian, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian,
        Indonesian, Italian, Mandarin, Portuguese (Brazilian and Portuguese),
        Spanish and Swahili but we&#39;d love to support more languages! Text
        that is not yet translated will be shown in English.
      </p>
      <h2 id="help-hedy-with-translations-easy-no-programming-needed-">
        Help Hedy with translations (easy, no programming needed!)
      </h2>
      <p>
        The easiest way to translate Hedy is by using the translation website of
        Weblate. You can find it
        <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/hedy">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first time you&#39;ll land on this page:
        <img
          src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28646458/156936569-9b8e2213-2789-4920-b746-0da22629dadc.jpg"
          alt="Weblate tour - Projects"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        You see many projects you can support by translating, one of them is
        Hedy. You may see a lock behind our name, when you see this, Hedy is
        locked for maintenance and translation is not possible. We&#39;ll try to
        prevent this as much as possible, but now you know it&#39;s possible.
        Click on Hedy to start with this project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now you&#39;ll see the different component within Hedy you can work on:
        <img
          src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28646458/156936765-cf5ae1ef-e40d-47c3-8706-041bdd1088c2.jpg"
          alt="Weblate tour - Components"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        On this page you see the progress of every component, calculated over
        all languages. At the time of this screenshot level-defaults was
        translated for 61% over 19 languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click on &quot;Languages&quot; in the menu on top to get to this screen:
        <img
          src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28646458/156936976-b740a30b-245b-4bc7-88bc-b70b7adf3afa.jpg"
          alt="Weblate tour - Languages"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Here you can see the progress of languages, calculated over all
        components. There are a few reasons why a translation is not complete.
        First of course, because texts are not yet translated. But on this
        screen you can see more reasons. Often, the 100% is nog reached because
        of checks that failed. This tool checks many things, like &quot;are
        question marks copied to the translation&quot;. The checks make
        translations better. You as a translator can dismiss any of these checks
        per text if you&#39;re sure it does not apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now click on Dutch to reach the following screen:
        <img
          src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28646458/156937240-dd24c51e-a100-4cd2-b160-c25b5e7a7827.jpg"
          alt="Weblate tour - Dutch"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        The components are shown again, but now with progress shown calculated
        for only Dutch. If you actually want to translate files for us, you have
        to register with Weblate. If you don&#39;t, you can still help. You can
        translate texts and click on &quot;suggest translation&quot;. Registered
        translators can use your suggestions. If you do register however, you
        can click on &quot;save and continue&quot; to actually save the
        translation within Hedy. Now, lets start looking at texts to translate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Click on Adventures to reach this screen:
        <img
          src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28646458/156937285-2418f2b9-5dcb-46ba-85e4-ad8266a8aae4.jpg"
          alt="Weblate tour - Adventures"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Now you see an overview of this component. Little too much information
        maybe :) Don&#39;t worry, just start with &quot;Labeled: Automatically
        translated&quot;. These are strings that have the English text in place
        of the translation. This is the way we set up texts. This way every text
        that has not been translated yet, is at least visible in English on the
        website. If you&#39;re a little more experienced, you might want to try
        some of the texts that have specific checks failing. At the right, you
        can choose between Translate or Zen.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose for Translate, you&#39;ll see this:
        <img
          src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28646458/156937676-0dfd72cd-8ccb-49d0-9ad7-bf10b3a7d906.jpg"
          alt="Weblate tour - Translate"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, maybe a little too much information, but a lot is very helpful.
        If your registered, you&#39;ll see a little more than others, this
        screen is from a registered user. Browse a little through this info.
        There is info about texts in the neighborhood, or suggestions of
        computer translations. If you think this is too much info for now, you
        can choose for the Zen option which looks like this:
        <img
          src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28646458/156937825-c5b97c10-3928-40b9-93d1-68a80371d51f.jpg"
          alt="Weblate tour - Zen"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        That&#39;s all for now, any problems, let us know so we can address them
        here for future translators. You can reach us at
        <a href="mailto:hello@hedy.org">hello@hedy.org</a>.
