    """A website module is a class with its own routes that can be mounted into an app.

    It's based on Flask Blueprints[1], but instead of defining an object and
    then registering routes on it, we put everything together in a class so that
    the routes can also share private variables that are injected from 'app.py', for example the database.
    The alternative (using a global g.db) would be untyped and
    then the IDE lacks information about the type causing less autocomplete support.

    Heavily inspired by [2].
